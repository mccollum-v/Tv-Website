<p>Roman Rodriguez plays Will Trent is one of my new favorit shows.  Will has dyslexia but he is the best agent in the office.</p>

    <p>When an APD agent goes missing, Will examines the crime scene and locates a secret message putting him back on the path to justice; with his lineage in question, Will realizes the answers he seeks have been in front of him all along.</p>
